Mrs Gail Smith;

Is 33 years old and lives in Newport, married to John, and has 2 kids, a boy and a girl.

Although mindful of the kids future and the legacy of what they will grow up into, Gail feels that she cannot single handedly change the world.

Each day, Gail jumps into her car and drives 6 km to work in the outer North West of the Melbourne CBD, whilst driving morning she hear on the radio of a new website devoted to helping the environment called "itCounts", an initiative of the General Assembly group as a community service.
The idea being that many people feel overwhelmed by the information overload, the massive tasks that are required to preserve our environment.

This app shows that each persons little action, totaled together can in fact make a difference, ItCounts, shows us how this can be achieved.
